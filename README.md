# OOPS in C++ Mini Projects

## To solidify the concepts of Object Oriented Programming that I learnt in C++, I made 3 classes which implement:-
- Dynamic Array
- Polynomials
- Fraction

## Concepts used:-
- Class and Object initialization
- Getters and Setters for private members
- Constructors and this keyword
- Inbuild Constructors and Destructor
- Shallow and Deep Copy
- Copy Constructor
- Initialization List
- Constant functions
- Static members
- Operator Overloading

## Note:-
- Each project folder contains the class file and the main file
- the 'main.cpp' needs to be run to see the class file in action
